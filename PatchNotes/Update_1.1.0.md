Update 8 support. Fade out filtered slots with no items. This update brought to you by Robb#6731




## New Stuff

- Slots with filters applied, but no items stored, are faded out to make it easier to tell them apart from slots with single items on them
  - There is a configuration option to disable the fading effect if it breaks something for you
