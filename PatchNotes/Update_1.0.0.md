Update 6 support. Fix that base-game tooltips were blocked by the mod (U6 bug). This update brought to you by Robb#6731




# Summary

- Fix that the mod prevented base-game slot hover tooltips from appearing, a bug introduced by Update 6
- No longer possible to modify the filters on machine output slots (consequence of bugfix)
- No longer possible to apply filters to slots that already contain items (consequence of bugfix)
- Now on version `1.0.0` so other mods can list this as a dependency without the pain caused by `^` special behavior for major versions less than one
